##The Giftbit Front-End HelloWorld Repo overview

In this exercise you will be tasked with a few Front-End objectives. In order to have a baseline project setup, avoid initial configuration issues and environment problems during the exercise, we are providing you this **HelloWorld Front-End** git repository that will provide the same format for everyone.

**Please note you are *NOT* expected to touch the `/SimpleServer` folder or any of the code there. This folder is included only for API demonstration purposes.**

All of your edits should take place within `/Website` directory where you are free to edit anything you wish.

###Setting Up

Once you have cloned/downloaded this repository, please feel free to modify and or enhance this project setup anyway you see fit. This set up doesn&rsquo;t count towards your time. You can use Compass, Guard, Grunt, Gulp, Scss, Sass, jQuery, React, Angular, Coffeescript, Foundation, Bootstrap, or whatever you feel will help you complete this within a maximum of 3 hours, which may well be kicking it vanilla&hellip;

You will be provided with a [Sketch][sktch] file &amp; PDF file (these files are the effectively the same, just in different formats) which will contain a simple layout you will be expected to recreate. Purchasing [Sketch][sktch] isn&rsquo;t a requirement, there is a 30 day free trial if you don&rsquo;t already own it, but we use it here at Giftbit and like it a lot. You could do this with just the PDF, but getting set up with [Sketch][sktch] will help you get more accurate dimensions and sizes.

Again, only make changes to the `/Website` folder and its&rsquo; contents!

_**Note**: We have provided the HEX values for the colours to be used in the design you will recieve in the_ `/Website/css/main.css` _on lines 60 &ndash; 66_

###Objective

You will be tasked with recreating a simple responsive layout and fetching some JSON data from a sample API endpoint. Your aim is to adhere to Web best practices for HTML5/CSS3/RWD, keeping your markup semantic and creating well formed _DRY_ CSS.

###Working on and submitting your exercise

There is no bias in evaluation for using SCSS vs. SASS vs. CSS, or Coffeescript vs. Vanilla JS etc.

At the beginning of your time slot, we will provide you with the sample design file and expected outcomes via email. At this time we&rsquo;ll aslk you to make an inital commit to your personal Github account (we&rsquo;ll need your Github username so we can know you&rsquo;re ready to begin the time slot). At or before the end of your 3 hour time slot, you&rsquo;ll send us the link to your repository and add read access collaborator privedges to `jamiegiftbit` Github account. We will take a look at your commits as well as the final state of the repository.

You are required to provide both a source version and a compiled version (if you&rsquo;re using any processors) for all HTML, CSS and or JS.

###How you will be evaluated

In the exercise, you will write HTML, JS and CSS (or any preprocessed flavour of) code to address a set problem given to you at the start of your time slot.  You should approach the exercise as if you were writing production-bound code. There is no bias in evaluation for using any task runners, tools or language features in your code.   **We will evaluate your submission based on the following criteria, in this order**:
 - Method and approach for displaying JSON aka JS competency
 - CSS naming conventions, JS coding style and HTML markup semantics - coding style
 - Approach to RWD
 - Ability to realize a design into code
 - Code, project structure and overall approach to the problem
 - Performance considerations

###Testing Mock API Server

 - You must have Node.js installed on your computer, if you don&rsquo;t you will need to download it
 - Node Package Manager (NPM) must also be installed and be up to date
 - You will need to know how to launch the server with `node app.js` or `npm start`
 - If your system is set up correctly when you run the `app.js` in your `SimpleServer` directory, you will see `Listening on port 3000...` in your terminal output
 - You will be able to browse to `http://localhost:3000/gift/` in your browser and see the output from the API response of all test gifts
 - You will be able to browse to `http://localhost:3000/gift/1` to `http://localhost:3000/gift/6` in your browser and see the output from the API response for the specified test gift by ID
 - You will be able to browse to `YOUR_LOCAL_PATH_HERE/Giftbit-Fed-Test-Master/Website/index.html` (wherever you decide to put it) and you&rsquo;ll see **Giftbit HelloWorld!** on the page and be able to see `Object "data is here!"` when you open the Chrome inspector Console

###Preparation checklist

 - Your Github username sent to interviewsupport@giftbit.com
 - Sample repository downloaded, and any supplimentary addons set up to your personal liking (frameworks, etc)
